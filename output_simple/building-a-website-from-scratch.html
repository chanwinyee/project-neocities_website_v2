<p>Dear Reader,</p>
<p>You must be here because you want to know more about me. Well, if you've made it this far, it's highly likely that you are a really kind person or you are someone I know personally. So, I will write these letters with these assumptions.</p>
<p>So, here we are on Neocities; a place where time has been frozen in the days of internet innocence - or so we like to remember.</p>
<p>I feel a whole lot of nostalgia for the internet of this time because I work for or with the less innocent internet companies of today. As you all probably know, I work in HR (or People) and often feel pretty separate from the debates and decisions over the more contentious aspects of <i>those</i> companies. I would say, though, that deep down inside, I long for a simpler life... but that's no surprise, is it, Reader? :)</p>
<p>Who would have thought that there may actually be a middle-road between the openness of social feeds and the privacy of an analog world?</p>
<p>Well, that's what I believe in - the middle road.</p>
<p>... Wow - what a heavy pre-amble. As usual, I just dive right into the serious thoughts, eh?</p>
<p>On to more lighter topics - this website in and of itself! Aside from my original Geocities (where it was a picture of me at the Grand Canyon at the ripe old age of 10 years and some funny gifs I found on the web), this is my first <i>real</i> website. Sure, I had a few pre-fabricated blog-type accounts, but this is the rawest form of website from my mind. </p>
<p>Like sharing my art, sharing this website feels like I am sharing something personal, sensitive, whatever word you want to replace "vulnerable" with. </p>
<p>Given that, this website is my first attempt at using CSS to stylize everything. I wrote this on a long airplane ride <i>sans internet</i>. I used some templates saved prior to the flight and the auto-fill helper in VisualStudio Code. While some people lean on StackExchange to unblock development, I muscled through without access to the World Wide Web. </p>
<p>Clearly, I'm really proud of how it came out!</p>
<p>Sure, there are a bunch of tools out there to build some more advanced websites (Gatsby.js, Flask, etc.) but I just needed a simple website. No ads, no continuous scroll, no analytics trackers, no "back-end." Just a website with some space to post up images of my work and long form text of my thoughts. :)</p>
