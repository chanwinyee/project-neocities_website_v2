    <p>I'm trying something new where I show up to my art desk each evening after dinner on nights when I am not watching TV. </p>
<p>I recently took a few photos of my neighborhood flowers so I decided to do a study of one that is a curious neon lavendar colour. </p>
<p>First attempt - I jumped right in to color on paper after a rough sketch. 
- This did not work well because I was not able to translate over the shades and values. I did not really study the photo so much as admire the subject matter. </p>
<p>Second attempt - I did a bit more to study the subject.
- Value study was done in graphite. While I was taking notes and interacting with the way light and shadow form the petals, I was also planning my approach to painting.
- Using a highly pigmented water cooler (Schminke), I applied a glazing technique to get the mid and low tones. I then mixed the water cooler with poster paint (Nicker) to hit those bright whites.
    - A note on poster paints: it's a bit shiny, not matte like gouache. It also emphasizes the muddiness of a pre-mixed color, so it may be good to tone it with purer pigments than from a pre-mixed wash.
- Used a masque-en for the first time to make the background. I may have over-applied and created a dramatic bond with the paper (and the pigments.) </p>
<p>All in all, a fun experiment!</p>
