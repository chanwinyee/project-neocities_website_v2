    <p>When working from books to learn something new, I know that the author has a learning plan set which is commonly found in the introduction or an "About this Book" section. The issue for self-guided learning is understanding how that book's structure fits into my current ability to read/concentrate on this topic week-on-week. </p>
<p><strong>The goal of this article is to break down book-guided learning into consumable pieces using Google Sheets and a bit of automation.</strong></p>
<p>By breaking down books into pieces that both follow the author's intended learning structure and respect my personal constraints, I am set up for continuous forward motion on multiple pursuits. Sure, progress at times may feel slow, but forward motion is always a positive gain. </p>
<p>Some of the constraints I deal with are - time, attention span, and fear of that "stuck" feeling where I am just not progressing on my project aspirations. (More constraints are best explained in my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/178_iYoByP8EPwmccpEoYohAQSfpDNdsAyH22KCCxYYg/edit?usp=sharing">Learn to Study Guide</a>.)</p>
<p>To respect these constraints, I designed a reading schedule that:
- Sets weekly reading assignments (not monthly or daily)
- Alerts me when the study load is going beyond my upper bound or is highly optimistic during times of ... you know... life.</p>
<p>So, how can I make something that gives me this information? Google Sheets! </p>
<p>When I first set up this spreadsheet (V1 and V2), it was painstakingly manual and, worse, it was inflexible. I had the most friction with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting week start dates (other than looking at a calendar)</li>
<li>Manually entering start and finish reading position for each chapter (even with some clunky formulas)</li>
<li>Re-working the entire manual process when I needed to make customizations</li>
<li>New years, new books required a repeat of this slow-and-painful data entry process making me question my goals in life</li>
</ul>
<p>After 2-3 years of tinkering, I landed on a data model-inspired ecosystem and used the power of sheet =QUERY() and data validation to semi-automate this process.</p>
<p><img src="/images/inline/20230811-datamodel_reading_schedule.jpg"></p>
<p>Key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily pick any book from desired interests with a one-time set up</li>
<li>Drop down menus to assign chapters with automated population of chapter attributes (such as start, end pages)</li>
<li>Drop down book selection</li>
<li>Week of Year (WoY) implementation to simplify week-start date settings</li>
</ul>
<p>At a high-level, set up for this type of study guide schedule is quite simple and does not require an advance degree in excel. </p>
<p>Skills required:</p>
<ul>
<li>=CONCAT()</li>
<li>=VLOOKUP()</li>
<li>=QUERY()</li>
<li>Data Entry and patience (but only one time per book!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up a dates sheet that has the columns: nixes, week of year, dates, day of week</li>
<li>Set up book details with columns: index, title, chapter, start, finish, total pages, ...</li>
<li>Use VLOOKUP to reference dates based on dates.index = CONCAT(week of year, date, day of week)</li>
<li>Set data validation (which automatically filters to distinct values in a column) for Book Title (row 1:1), Chapter, etc.</li>
<li>Use =QUERY() on schedule sheet some rows down to pull in the chapter and pages columns.</li>
<li>Set data validation on the schedule sheet for chapter names in the main schedule section.</li>
<li>Use VLOOKUP to reference book and chapter to get start-finish attributes.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are planning to make this schedule and have questions or want templates, DM me! I am more than happy to assist. :) Good luck!</p>
