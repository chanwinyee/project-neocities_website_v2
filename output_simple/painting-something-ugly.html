  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Today, I finished a painting from the WTF Still Life how-to book and I am not in love with it. </p>
<p>I understand that these books were written in the late 50's and the photo references are of that time. I also understand that I could just disengage from that prompt. But I am a completist - and being a completist means muscling through exercises that I may not be thrilled about. </p>
<p>For this piece, I experimented with doing a bit of preparation before laying some paint down with the expectation that I would have a beautiful and finished work. I studied the turquoise marbles in gouache and oil. I practiced the shapes in pencil and set the canvas up with an under painting. I also went in with a mixing plan - starting with mid tones and giving myself warm and cold variations to mix with.</p>
<p>During that preparation time, I spent a lot of time with the source material. And during that time, I couldn't help but notice the absence of any attachment to the subject. </p>
<p>In one of my community art courses, the instructor advised the class to bring in a source photo of something that we cared about - a pet, a place, etc. At the time, she explained that we should work with something that we feel comfortable engaging with over a long period of time. Two years later, I now realize the value of an emotional attachment to the source material, great or small. </p>
<p>So, for this assignment, instead of working and re-working the piece until I felt that familiar gratification, I just stopped. And that's okay.</p>
