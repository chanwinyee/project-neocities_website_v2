    <h1><a href="/pages/about-me.html">About Me</a></h1>
  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>Thanks for dropping into my website! I'm Liz (aka. Chanwinyee, aka winyee.) </p>
<p>First and foremost, I am an introvert (INF-J) and a hobbyist.</p>
<p>Second, I am an artist.</p>
<p>Third, I am a Data Engineer.</p>
<h1>Genesis Story</h1>
<p>So, why do I open by stating my introversion? Because, since I realized and fully embraced this part of my personality in my late 20's, I have liberated my confidence! So, yes, I am introverted, extremely authentic, and here to share out some of the little things that give me joy.</p>
<p>My childhood was a pretty sheltered one being much younger than my sisters and with strict parents. That means that I spent a <em>lot</em> of time indoors, by myself, with mostly my imagination and creativity to pass the time. It's from there that the foundation for my obsession with little projects began.</p>
<h1><img src="/images/graphics/repo-crop.png" style="height:150px"> <strong>Hobbies, Projects, Interests</strong></h1>
<p>Anything that is not visual art, I qualify as a hobby for no other reason than as a testament to the truly random nature of these projects and interests. Below is a list of examples, and it is definitely growing:</p>
<p>Piano, flute, guitar, website building, knitting, crocheting, sewing, gardening, running, cycling, yoga, ballet, Dungeons and Dragons, hiking, camping, Boggle, reading, embroidery, clarinet, ukulele, Arduino, hacking, retro-technology, baking, cooking, self-improvement, reading, COFFEE, crafting, gaming, writing, bullet journaling, ...</p>
<h1><img src="/images/graphics/Hobbyist-crop.png" style="height:150px"> Art Things</h1>
<p>So, I did not include ART as a hobby, because it is a category all on its own. </p>
<p><em>Making art</em> is one part of this interest and learning/talking about <em>art history</em> is the other part. </p>
<p>As a kid, I shed away from taking an art class because I thought "art critiques" were a place where you are berated by your peers. (Yes, I know that's totally wrong.) But either way, this meant that I self-taught all I know about art using <a href="https://www.creativebug.com">Creative Bug</a>, books I've collected over the years, and some classes offered by my community college. </p>
<p>Generally, I'm multi-disciplinary, but my mediums tend to lean towards <em>oil painting, pencil and illustration, and water colour.</em> </p>
<p>Having said that, I am always open to exploring.</p>
<h1><img src="/images/graphics/engineer-crop.jpg" style="height:150px"> Data Engineering</h1>
<p>I have a liberal arts degree and I mostly worked in operations either as a coordinator, project manager, or analyst. </p>
<p>Only recently have I been able to call myself a professional (self-taught) Data Engineer. I applied my query-language knowledge and a strict study schedule to acquire the required Python skillset.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more, email me or check out these resources to start:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>At the heart of all this is my obsession with process, order, and the confidence that numbers bring. Knowing this about myself has helped me navigate my career and will hopefully carry me through if and when new opportunities come up. </p>
<h1>Thanks!</h1>
<p>Finally, I am grateful. Thank <em>you</em> for dropping in, learning a bit about me, and seeing some of my projects.  </p>
