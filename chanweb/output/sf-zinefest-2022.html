  <div class="article_text">
    <p>This weekend, I ventured to San Francisco to attend the SF Zinefest. It is there that I experienced my first celebrity siting and made a blubbering fool of myself. </p>
<p>Have you ever heard of SailorHG? ComputeCuter? Well, let me tell you all the things I wanted to say, and in so doing, you will understand the gravity of this encounter.</p>
<p>I am quite a fan of SailorHG. I instantly felt connected to her art content, as I am sure many have, due to our mutual love of Naoko Takeuchiâ€™s series Sailor Moon, and in effect, the need to be surrounded by cute pastel things. As for Sailor Moon characters, it was the brainy one - Ami Chiu/Sailor Mercury - who caught my eye. Maybe it was because of her introversion or the fact that she was a technologist and could maneuver scenarios with Spock-like logic. Either way, I felt seen by her character, and similarly felt seen by sailorhg's kawaii-style techno-art.</p>
<p>After joining the tech world as a non-technical admin, I was reinforced with the idea that engineering is brutalist in style. Minimalism, mechanism, m-a-l-e, and most likely impossible for me to be a part of. </p>
<p>Well, a couple years ago, the world went into a lockdown and I stopped going into the office. My interactions turned internet-ward and it was there that I stumbled upon computecuter.com. This static site is where I found my permission to be technical AND floral, pastel, and FEM-a-l-e. I started pushing my engineering boundaries and challenging my negative-self-talk. Eventually, I was embracing that being technical or engineering minded could be done in <em>my own style</em>.</p>
<p>I wish I hadn't been so starstruck at the event, or I would have not been so nervous. I would eloquently let her know that she enabled me to pursue my dream career - that there is a place for someone like me in tech and in art.</p>
<p>But of course, what happened was my brain went blank and I was sweating and shaking for 5 crazy minutes and then I had to decompress in the corner with my partner. :) </p>
<p>At least I made it home with a zine and a cool shirt!</p>
