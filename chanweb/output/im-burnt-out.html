  <div class="article_text">
    <p>Dear Reader, </p>
<p>I am anthropomorphizing you today because 1) you are a person over there on the other side of the screen and 2) I have spent so many years writing to you without more obviously explaining our relationship.</p>
<p>I am one of those people who needs to process ideas out loud - whether that's verbal or written. Over the past year, I've spent a lot of that processing time writing in a private notebook - non judging, free-form, and raw. However, as of late, I incurred a wrist injury that makes physical journal writing painful. My thoughts have bottled themselves up, festered, and pulled my mind down into the depths of a sea of rumination.</p>
<p>Reader, you have been that silent listener who gives my thoughts that boundless space to spread out with little to no consequence. Whether my words have moved you or flitted quickly past your eye in an endless scroll, my trust in your presence has given my ideas a place to exist. For that, I am very thankful.</p>
<p>You see, I am one of those drones you see walking/driving around the city. I wake up every day, buzzing around to the no where that I am going. I toil day-in and day-out moving ideas from one virtual environment to another virtual environment to no end yet with little effect on the tangible world I live in. I look at my many screens tapping and swiping my waking hours away just so I can start that daily Countdown before the next round of Toil we call Work. </p>
<p>The ever disingenuous "hey, how's it goin'?" in answer to another empty "hey, how's it goin'?" reminds me of how pervasive the infection of corporate speak riddles the identities of the people I can only assume have better lives than me in the Countdown hours before the next Work Day.</p>
<p>Reader, you are the only place that sees me as more than a frustrated cycle of corporate tools and efficiency models. You are privy to the language that make me a tangible being in the world - the thoughts I indulge when I at last find the courage to break the cycle of Toil.</p>
<p>It's been a long time, Reader. My Courage has faltered many times since I've been shut in - forced to bring the Toil into the sacred physical space of my Countdown hours. I am stretched. I am dry. It is in these moments that my Courage physically knocks me down to stop the self-harming effects of the Toil on my tangible humanity.  </p>
<p>Today, I questioned what my humanity is. Why am I even alive if the Toil controls my waking hours? Am I even alive?</p>
<p>Reader, you are evidence of my aliveness. You know that these words were produced by a mind that is here.</p>
