    <p>Showing up and trying something new.</p>
    <p>I'm trying something new where I show up to my art desk each evening after dinner on nights when I am not watching TV. </p>
<p>I recently took a few photos of my neighborhood flowers so I decided to do a study of one that is a curious neon lavendar colour. </p>
<p>First attempt - I jumped right in to color on paper after a rough sketch. 
- This did not work well because I was not able to translate over the shades and values. I did not really study the photo so much as admire the subject matter. </p>
<p>Second attempt - I did a bit more to study the subject.
- Value study was done in graphite. While I was taking notes and interacting with the way light and shadow form the petals, I was also planning my approach to painting.
- Using a highly pigmented water cooler (Schminke), I applied a glazing technique to get the mid and low tones. I then mixed the water cooler with poster paint (Nicker) to hit those bright whites.
    - A note on poster paints: it's a bit shiny, not matte like gouache. It also emphasizes the muddiness of a pre-mixed color, so it may be good to tone it with purer pigments than from a pre-mixed wash.
- Used a masque-en for the first time to make the background. I may have over-applied and created a dramatic bond with the paper (and the pigments.) </p>
<p>All in all, a fun experiment!</p>

    <p>Going retro with some watercolour how-to's.</p>
    <p>Today, I finished a painting from the WTF Still Life how-to book and I am not in love with it. </p>
<p>I understand that these books were written in the late 50's and the photo references are of that time. I also understand that I could just disengage from that prompt. But I am a completist - and being a completist means muscling through exercises that I may not be thrilled about. </p>
<p>For this piece, I experimented with doing a bit of preparation before laying some paint down with the expectation that I would have a beautiful and finished work. I studied the turquoise marbles in gouache and oil. I practiced the shapes in pencil and set the canvas up with an under painting. I also went in with a mixing plan - starting with mid tones and giving myself warm and cold variations to mix with.</p>
<p>During that preparation time, I spent a lot of time with the source material. And during that time, I couldn't help but notice the absence of any attachment to the subject. </p>
<p>In one of my community art courses, the instructor advised the class to bring in a source photo of something that we cared about - a pet, a place, etc. At the time, she explained that we should work with something that we feel comfortable engaging with over a long period of time. Two years later, I now realize the value of an emotional attachment to the source material, great or small. </p>
<p>So, for this assignment, instead of working and re-working the piece until I felt that familiar gratification, I just stopped. And that's okay.</p>

<p>A Study in Two Mediums - my exploration of water colour</p>
<p>A few months ago, I received my Grandfather's collection of art books - the Walter T. Foster series from the late 60's. You may recognize them now going for about $7 per book on the shelves of your local Blick Art Supply Store. (My grandfather's books still have their price tag of $1.00 per. After a cursory search for supporting source materials by the same series, I observed the price of these books go from $1.00 to $1.50 and $2.00 and so on. Oh, the joys of inflation!)</p>
<p>I joke that I decided to learn more about water colour in 2021 so I can put some experience to my dislike of the medium. The truth is, I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and gain some level of competence over such a ubiquitous form of art. With plenty of vintage resources on hand, I felt well equipped to commence.</p>
<p>A few things I learned in my water colour practice:
- Water colour is the balance of strategically acting on paint as I watch it hit various stages of "drying"
- Layers, layers, layers
- Swatching reveals all
- Start broad and general, then indulge in the details (similar to oil)
- It is going to look pretty disappointing until it doesn't
- Patience. (I'm watching paint dry, aren't I?)
- Happy accidents happen, but water colour is an intentional technique. Try again.</p>
<p>Given all these realizations, this meant that most of my final water colour pieces were attempted at least twice. :)</p>
<p>What I am showing here is the last project to transition me back to my oil painting ways and commend my perseverance with the (sometimes) frustrating medium of water colour. </p>
<p>The water colour piece was attempted twice. The first time, I tried to keep the concept broad and general and let my confidence apply the first layer of yellow wash. As I continued to add my second colour (red), I realized I was cornered into a short range of hues - I had started off with too deep of a yellow. Turns out, broadness doesn't just mean shape; it also means hue. I also forgot the leave space for the whites and my apples were sinking into the image. Bah!</p>
<p>After some space from the subject, I tried again and found with patience, masking fluid, and a mindful approach to colour composition, I could actually produce something that felt realistic. In other words, I am quite proud of how I pushed my mind through this last work-through.</p>
<p>This water colour opened my eyes to the true indulgence of detail that water colour allows. I could really feel the subject's dimensions manifest with each layer of translucent paint deepening the colours. I could play in minute details with little risk as I gently concentrated pigment in semi-dry areas. Unlike my oils, the water colours created a crisper and thus more realistic end product.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now that it is 2022 and I finished not one but three books* on water colour practice, I've decided to go back to home base and pick up my oil paints again. It felt nice to work through the familiar development points of pencil, shaggy first colour layers, and eventually refinement. I can work and rework areas of the image until I feel it's ready and I can take my time on my own pace irrespective of the dryness and wetness. While I feel the water colour let me play a bit more with the tiniest of details, I enjoy the generalization I bring to my subjects in oil. </p>
<p>More interestingly, I think I am starting to recognize a style emerging at this point with my oils. While my water colours have an almost accidentally realistic feel accompanied by a slightly uncomfortable wobble (markings of a dedicated novice!), my oils have a more confident presence. They are stylized and simplified - details are there but mostly by suggestion and movement over flat-on appearance. While do indulge in the details, it feels a lot less meticulous than water colour and as a result, I can take in the whole painting and assess before I act.</p>
<p>I know in the long run, I will never escape the practice of water colour. Simply put, it is just easy to bring around on trips and I can finish a single piece in one sitting. I do also enjoy a meticulous bout with details once in a while - an indulgence that is both (maybe equally?) mind wracking and rewarding... when I have the patience to watch paint dry. </p>
