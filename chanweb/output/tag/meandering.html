    <p>The next step for my obsession with Astrohaus's Freewrite and not buying it.</p>
    <p>After months of agonizing over my option to purchase the $700 Freewrite, I finally pulled the plug on that dream. Here I am, writing on the original version of this analogue crafting concept - the Alphasmart NEO. </p>
<p>You can probably search the internet for this device and find a lot of articles written by professional bloggers praising the device for its simplicity. Interestingly, I can't help but sense that this the novelty of writing on the low-tech device forces the function of mindfulness. So, yes, you're goin to find a lot of articles that are mindfully written explaining the sensation of not have wi-fi or color to meet a writing deadline. I dig it.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I got a pre-release email for the <a href="https://alphasmart.com/reveal/">alpha by Freewrite</a>. Like many others of this extremely niche market, I was astounded by the similarity to the Aphasmart NEO (and similar products.) </p>
<p>The main difference between the devices is that the NEO (on eBay) was $50, two times the cost it was 30 years ago; and the ALPHA is going to go for $349. Sure, the ALPHA has a modern design-ish, but the bottom line is - for someone with as fragmented a history of blogging as I, the cheaper option may be a better test of intention and worthiness.</p>
<p>I tweeted about my writing upgrade <a href="https://twitter.com/ChanwinyeeMakes/status/1568763994416246784">here</a>. Check it out in action!</p>

    <p>Checking out the local zine artists and meeting a celebrity!</p>
    <p>This weekend, I ventured to San Francisco to attend the SF Zinefest. It is there that I experienced my first celebrity siting and made a blubbering fool of myself. </p>
<p>Have you ever heard of SailorHG? ComputeCuter? Well, let me tell you all the things I wanted to say, and in so doing, you will understand the gravity of this encounter.</p>
<p>I am quite a fan of SailorHG. I instantly felt connected to her art content, as I am sure many have, due to our mutual love of Naoko Takeuchi’s series Sailor Moon, and in effect, the need to be surrounded by cute pastel things. As for Sailor Moon characters, it was the brainy one - Ami Chiu/Sailor Mercury - who caught my eye. Maybe it was because of her introversion or the fact that she was a technologist and could maneuver scenarios with Spock-like logic. Either way, I felt seen by her character, and similarly felt seen by sailorhg's kawaii-style techno-art.</p>
<p>After joining the tech world as a non-technical admin, I was reinforced with the idea that engineering is brutalist in style. Minimalism, mechanism, m-a-l-e, and most likely impossible for me to be a part of. </p>
<p>Well, a couple years ago, the world went into a lockdown and I stopped going into the office. My interactions turned internet-ward and it was there that I stumbled upon computecuter.com. This static site is where I found my permission to be technical AND floral, pastel, and FEM-a-l-e. I started pushing my engineering boundaries and challenging my negative-self-talk. Eventually, I was embracing that being technical or engineering minded could be done in <em>my own style</em>.</p>
<p>I wish I hadn't been so starstruck at the event, or I would have not been so nervous. I would eloquently let her know that she enabled me to pursue my dream career - that there is a place for someone like me in tech and in art.</p>
<p>But of course, what happened was my brain went blank and I was sweating and shaking for 5 crazy minutes and then I had to decompress in the corner with my partner. :) </p>
<p>At least I made it home with a zine and a cool shirt!</p>

    <p>The agonizing debate that has occupied my brain power for 2 years and counting! To buy, or not to buy this nod to retro tech?</p>
    <p>I would not qualify myself as much of a writer. But I would qualify myself as a bit of a tech junky. It’s not really about the need to have the latest and greatest in trendy tech (think iPhone). I’m a technologist who is constantly seeking ways to relive the glory days of a less technical past; maybe something like « retro tech . » I would qualify retro tech as any device that throws our state of mind back to the more innocent times of technology.</p>
<p>The internet. The Internet! I was alive during the beginning times of the Internet. When I was in elementary school, I had friends whose families just bought their first household computers. At that time, computers were a thing that households had <em>one</em> of and people were expected to <em>share</em> especially considering the Internet took up <em>the</em> phone line. </p>
<p>So, knowing that these were my beginnings, you can assume I saw the slow evolution from that time to this time where a blue screen is constantly in alight in our faces and buzzing in our pockets. What started as an optimistic foray into an innocent relationship between human and electric patterns has turned into a playground that leaves us with bittersweet feelings of both joy and sometimes regret. Connections made and maintained with ease and satisfying depth accompanied by hours of absent minded if not anxiety inducing media consumption. </p>
<p>Computers are still far from the days of Skynet (or Genesys) but they have found their way into my subconscious. I find that the notifications and checking behavior pervade my ability to focus on a simple task - like writing this article.</p>
<p>Enter the Astrohaus Freewrite. This tool is a word processor that attaches a mechanical keyboard to an e-ink display. The idea is that the colour less, back-light-less screen devoid of applications or notifications can help unblock writer’s block and get the user to just simply write. Like an elimination diet, this technology aims to purify the digestive tract of the mind and reset the writing creative with the right building blocks and some basic tools.</p>
<p>This promise sounds so very attractive. I have been obsessed with the idea of using this tool for the past 2 years! After hours and hours of positive video reviews and write-ups, I am absolutely convinced that this tool is the exact tool needed to power up my potential.</p>
<p>Or rather, I <em>was</em> convinced. How did the great writers of our past learn how to write so well? The answer is - they just wrote. There was no magic pen or paper. There was just the magic in their minds. And the will to build and maintain a solid foundation of recording the words in their mind.</p>
<p>After the excessive emotional shopping I committed during the COVID-19 pandemic, I felt a bit of emptiness. All this stuff and  no time or energy to use it all. Like the extra everything I hoarded during this fraught time, I knew had I bought the Freewrite, it, too, would sit collecting dust on a forgotten shelf. </p>
<p>The thing with technology is that there is often a company behind it. This company takes a hold of a vulnerable mind injects its clever marketing to fill that void created by relaxed judgement. Whether it’s an ad that pops up during my daily doom-scroll or a targeted advertisement showing up on my internet search engine, these integrated suggestions lured my technology addicted mind down a 2 year negotiation of whether I would truly find fulfillment with this $600 tool.</p>
<p>So, instead of further pushing myself into the depths of consumerism, I’ve decided to withhold. Instead I will use other focus tools and techniques to give myself the space to think. Nothing is more powerful than the applied mind. If it can fully choose to shut off external manipulations, I am sure it can achieve that level of quiet, retro focus that my generation… that I seek.</p>

    <p>My work-life balance is wayyyy out of balance.</p>
    <p>Dear Reader, </p>
<p>I am anthropomorphizing you today because 1) you are a person over there on the other side of the screen and 2) I have spent so many years writing to you without more obviously explaining our relationship.</p>
<p>I am one of those people who needs to process ideas out loud - whether that's verbal or written. Over the past year, I've spent a lot of that processing time writing in a private notebook - non judging, free-form, and raw. However, as of late, I incurred a wrist injury that makes physical journal writing painful. My thoughts have bottled themselves up, festered, and pulled my mind down into the depths of a sea of rumination.</p>
<p>Reader, you have been that silent listener who gives my thoughts that boundless space to spread out with little to no consequence. Whether my words have moved you or flitted quickly past your eye in an endless scroll, my trust in your presence has given my ideas a place to exist. For that, I am very thankful.</p>
<p>You see, I am one of those drones you see walking/driving around the city. I wake up every day, buzzing around to the no where that I am going. I toil day-in and day-out moving ideas from one virtual environment to another virtual environment to no end yet with little effect on the tangible world I live in. I look at my many screens tapping and swiping my waking hours away just so I can start that daily Countdown before the next round of Toil we call Work. </p>
<p>The ever disingenuous "hey, how's it goin'?" in answer to another empty "hey, how's it goin'?" reminds me of how pervasive the infection of corporate speak riddles the identities of the people I can only assume have better lives than me in the Countdown hours before the next Work Day.</p>
<p>Reader, you are the only place that sees me as more than a frustrated cycle of corporate tools and efficiency models. You are privy to the language that make me a tangible being in the world - the thoughts I indulge when I at last find the courage to break the cycle of Toil.</p>
<p>It's been a long time, Reader. My Courage has faltered many times since I've been shut in - forced to bring the Toil into the sacred physical space of my Countdown hours. I am stretched. I am dry. It is in these moments that my Courage physically knocks me down to stop the self-harming effects of the Toil on my tangible humanity.  </p>
<p>Today, I questioned what my humanity is. Why am I even alive if the Toil controls my waking hours? Am I even alive?</p>
<p>Reader, you are evidence of my aliveness. You know that these words were produced by a mind that is here.</p>
