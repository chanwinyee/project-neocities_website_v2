    <p>A strange encounter at the hotel cafeteria.</p>
    <p>I’m here at the cafeteria of the Hampton Inn. My phone went off at 6:30am, but I was already awake. The sun peeped through the windows with the vigour of a midday show.</p>
<p>The plan today is to go to Hearst Castle. A 40 minute drive to the visitor center before the 30 minute winding road up to the property. I’m looking forward to the tour even if we’ve done it once before. My biggest concern is the heat and UV. Yesterday, at lunch, we ate outside and I was sunburned through my top. </p>
<p>Here at the cafe, there is a family celebrating graduation (or similar.) They are a Texan family who boasted loudly of their gun collection and mentioned the mass shootings in the Bay Area - San Jose. The tone was relaxed; a sharp contrast to the low and muted murmur of a community shocked and saddened. “I have an AR-15,” drawled the new grad with a casual, if not praise-seeking voice. Her boy friend smartly replied with a glowing review of their recent shooting range date before sliding past the crowd to grab breakfast. The extended family glowed proudly, confident that the next generation will carry on the family tradition.</p>
<p>As the boyfriend passed, we locked eyes. </p>
<p>For a man coming from a culture that identifies himself as the norm and me, a Chinese woman, as “other”, I could not help but wonder what kind of mental math ran through his mind in that moment. 
—————
What a strange interaction. These interactions give me pause and a heightened sense of awareness.</p>

    <p>The poetry of a steep incline.</p>
    <p>It was a 5 mile climb up 1,300 feet of elevation. I started out my door at 7:00am with a perfectly ripe banana in my belly and two hydration packs filled with optimism. </p>
<p>There were moments where the incline appeared low. But these deceptions are a guaranteed slow burn on my quads. The Berkeley terrain is a mix of self-sustaining urban farms pregnant with dropping stone fruits and the flittering of squirrels or maybe budgies tossing dry leaves in search of seed. I typically run in the middle of the road this early in the morning - opting for the view of the horizon and an unobstructed panoramic view of my path forward. With my ears free of any buds and my mind given reprieve from the drone of my rumination, I like to take these quiet hours of the morning to embrace the beauty of my city. </p>
<p>I ran upwards into the Berkeley Hills gritting my teeth through the challenge of the improbably steep blocks of Cedar, Shasta, and Grizzly Peak. Every stop for breath came with a barrage of encouraging self-pep talk: “You are strong!” “You’ve already recovered your breathing, great work!” “Long slow distance. Just enjoy this!” </p>
<p>As I neared the peak of my planned route, I noticed the air around me was thick with mist. Visibility was at 20-30 feet at best. This is the morning-dew taking rise to float across the world’s atmosphere. I could not help but deeply breathe in this aspirated volume of atmospheric river. I know some of this air came from Africa, the mountains of China, the snows of the Arctic. This damp smell is a mix of the moss and redwood decay, but it no doubt contains particulate dust rich in the nutrients of the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>Some people don’t believe in a higher power. But how can you deny the beauty and might of the life-water that powers the great blue marble we call Earth?</p>
