        <br>Liz found a great deal on a round-trip flight to NYC so we flew to the Big Apple for our 6 year anniversary.

<p>Upon the writing of this page, it is not yet the end of the year. We still have plans for the rest of December to re-commence our annual East Coast holiday travel to Annandale, Virginia and Toronto Ontario. </p>
<p>2022 was a bit of a wild year. The pandemic feels further and further in the past (with bursts of "hey! I'm still here!") I know we are exhuasted by waves of Official Guidance and over-abundance of caution, but I am so thankful that within all that we found pockets of time to safely gather and celebrate the closeness of our relationships. </p>
<p>With that, we wish you a happy and healthy 2023! </p>
<p>Sincerely,
Liz and Mason

  </div>
  <div class="article_meta">
    <p>Posted on: Sat 10 September 2022</p>
  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>Learning to live without the social media, then easing back in.</p>
    <p>For the past 2-3 months, I have been without Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. This is not a personal vendetta against social media. It is simply a step away from the forces that seem to have a somewhat unreasonable hold over my free time.</p>
<p>I personally do not have a strong opinion about Social Media as some do. I just recognize that it has a lot of issues that give me pause.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is addictive.</li>
<li>Social Media can make or break self-validation in the creative world.</li>
<li>Comparison is the enemy of joy and so is its conduit.</li>
<li>It can foster inauthentic or parasympathetic relationships and give the illusion of community where none exists.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was not burned by SM, I simply wanted to do more with my free time and pump my calendar with intentional minutes. But now, after some space, I feel I have a use for SM as a <em>tool</em> rather than entertainment. This can either be a gateway to SM-Hell or the beginnings of a healthy relationship to SM.</p>
<p>What comes to mind is the question of whether it is even reasonable to strive to be an internet hermit.</p>
<p>I am an office-job worker. This means that my entire job is on the Internet. So internet hermitage is impossible 20-25 hours per week. Discounting sleeping hours (56 hours per week), that means ~85 hours a week can potentially be "free" of the internet. But, then, how do I optimize these precious 85 hours peppered throughout the week? <em>I use the internet to search things!</em> </p>
<p>So the question becomes - who is the enemy? Is it the internet and all its temptations? Does it even matter?</p>
<p>What I am trying to get at is the fact that the environment has changed. I cannot continue the pattern of blaming every innovation for succumbing to the greedy manipulations of corporations. That is literally always going to happen. It is up to the power of my mind to know when to step back and when to wade in the waters of the ocean. </p>
<p>All of this was to set the stage. I am mindfully engaging with SM by splitting my intentions into different accounts.</p>
<h2>My personal accounts</h2>
<ul>
<li>I have a personal Twitter. This only has bi-directional relationships with people that I still talk to or would stop in the street to chat with for a few minutes if the chance ever came up.</li>
<li>I have a public Twitter. This is <a href="https://twitter.com/chanwinyeemakes">@chanwinyeemakes</a>. The goal of this account is to share the process of my work - thoughts and photos together. While I do enjoy watching a good Instagram story, the pressure to perform on that platform is too high. There's a lot more mental work that a photo or a marginally acceptable IG Story can capture. Short form blog is the best route for me.</li>
<li>Speaking of Instagram, I have a private account that I really don't use. The platform has become too advertisement-heavy (via influencers and rising influencers-to-be) that I am coming to terms with the notion that IG is not a place where I have authentic interactions with my peers, family, and friends.</li>
<li>I have a public Instagram - <a href="http://instagram.com/winyee.art/">@winyee.art</a>. This will eventually become my portfolio. Simple as that.</li>
</ul>
<p>By dividing my interfaces in such a way, I can make sure I am in a healthy state of mind. I can also practice varying types of openness depending on the platform and break through my internet shy-ness. Eventually, my interaction with SM will hopefully start becoming a two-way conversation.</p>
<p>Social Media, like the internet itself, is just a tool and it's here to stay. While outright rejection may be the first defensive response to its alluring power, coexistence or even mastery may be the best long-term approach.</p>

  <div class="article_text">
    <p>The next step for my obsession with Astrohaus's Freewrite and not buying it.</p>
    <p>After months of agonizing over my option to purchase the $700 Freewrite, I finally pulled the plug on that dream. Here I am, writing on the original version of this analogue crafting concept - the Alphasmart NEO. </p>
<p>You can probably search the internet for this device and find a lot of articles written by professional bloggers praising the device for its simplicity. Interestingly, I can't help but sense that this the novelty of writing on the low-tech device forces the function of mindfulness. So, yes, you're goin to find a lot of articles that are mindfully written explaining the sensation of not have wi-fi or color to meet a writing deadline. I dig it.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I got a pre-release email for the <a href="https://alphasmart.com/reveal/">alpha by Freewrite</a>. Like many others of this extremely niche market, I was astounded by the similarity to the Aphasmart NEO (and similar products.) </p>
<p>The main difference between the devices is that the NEO (on eBay) was $50, two times the cost it was 30 years ago; and the ALPHA is going to go for $349. Sure, the ALPHA has a modern design-ish, but the bottom line is - for someone with as fragmented a history of blogging as I, the cheaper option may be a better test of intention and worthiness.</p>
<p>I tweeted about my writing upgrade <a href="https://twitter.com/ChanwinyeeMakes/status/1568763994416246784">here</a>. Check it out in action!</p>

    <p>Checking out the local zine artists and meeting a celebrity!</p>
    <p>This weekend, I ventured to San Francisco to attend the SF Zinefest. It is there that I experienced my first celebrity siting and made a blubbering fool of myself. </p>
<p>Have you ever heard of SailorHG? ComputeCuter? Well, let me tell you all the things I wanted to say, and in so doing, you will understand the gravity of this encounter.</p>
<p>I am quite a fan of SailorHG. I instantly felt connected to her art content, as I am sure many have, due to our mutual love of Naoko Takeuchiâ€™s series Sailor Moon, and in effect, the need to be surrounded by cute pastel things. As for Sailor Moon characters, it was the brainy one - Ami Chiu/Sailor Mercury - who caught my eye. Maybe it was because of her introversion or the fact that she was a technologist and could maneuver scenarios with Spock-like logic. Either way, I felt seen by her character, and similarly felt seen by sailorhg's kawaii-style techno-art.</p>
<p>After joining the tech world as a non-technical admin, I was reinforced with the idea that engineering is brutalist in style. Minimalism, mechanism, m-a-l-e, and most likely impossible for me to be a part of. </p>
<p>Well, a couple years ago, the world went into a lockdown and I stopped going into the office. My interactions turned internet-ward and it was there that I stumbled upon computecuter.com. This static site is where I found my permission to be technical AND floral, pastel, and FEM-a-l-e. I started pushing my engineering boundaries and challenging my negative-self-talk. Eventually, I was embracing that being technical or engineering minded could be done in <em>my own style</em>.</p>
<p>I wish I hadn't been so starstruck at the event, or I would have not been so nervous. I would eloquently let her know that she enabled me to pursue my dream career - that there is a place for someone like me in tech and in art.</p>
<p>But of course, what happened was my brain went blank and I was sweating and shaking for 5 crazy minutes and then I had to decompress in the corner with my partner. :) </p>
<p>At least I made it home with a zine and a cool shirt!</p>
