    <p>Going retro with some watercolour how-to's.</p>
    <p>Today, I finished a painting from the WTF Still Life how-to book and I am not in love with it. </p>
<p>I understand that these books were written in the late 50's and the photo references are of that time. I also understand that I could just disengage from that prompt. But I am a completist - and being a completist means muscling through exercises that I may not be thrilled about. </p>
<p>For this piece, I experimented with doing a bit of preparation before laying some paint down with the expectation that I would have a beautiful and finished work. I studied the turquoise marbles in gouache and oil. I practiced the shapes in pencil and set the canvas up with an under painting. I also went in with a mixing plan - starting with mid tones and giving myself warm and cold variations to mix with.</p>
<p>During that preparation time, I spent a lot of time with the source material. And during that time, I couldn't help but notice the absence of any attachment to the subject. </p>
<p>In one of my community art courses, the instructor advised the class to bring in a source photo of something that we cared about - a pet, a place, etc. At the time, she explained that we should work with something that we feel comfortable engaging with over a long period of time. Two years later, I now realize the value of an emotional attachment to the source material, great or small. </p>
<p>So, for this assignment, instead of working and re-working the piece until I felt that familiar gratification, I just stopped. And that's okay.</p>

    <p>The poetry of a steep incline.</p>
    <p>It was a 5 mile climb up 1,300 feet of elevation. I started out my door at 7:00am with a perfectly ripe banana in my belly and two hydration packs filled with optimism. </p>
<p>There were moments where the incline appeared low. But these deceptions are a guaranteed slow burn on my quads. The Berkeley terrain is a mix of self-sustaining urban farms pregnant with dropping stone fruits and the flittering of squirrels or maybe budgies tossing dry leaves in search of seed. I typically run in the middle of the road this early in the morning - opting for the view of the horizon and an unobstructed panoramic view of my path forward. With my ears free of any buds and my mind given reprieve from the drone of my rumination, I like to take these quiet hours of the morning to embrace the beauty of my city. </p>
<p>I ran upwards into the Berkeley Hills gritting my teeth through the challenge of the improbably steep blocks of Cedar, Shasta, and Grizzly Peak. Every stop for breath came with a barrage of encouraging self-pep talk: “You are strong!” “You’ve already recovered your breathing, great work!” “Long slow distance. Just enjoy this!” </p>
<p>As I neared the peak of my planned route, I noticed the air around me was thick with mist. Visibility was at 20-30 feet at best. This is the morning-dew taking rise to float across the world’s atmosphere. I could not help but deeply breathe in this aspirated volume of atmospheric river. I know some of this air came from Africa, the mountains of China, the snows of the Arctic. This damp smell is a mix of the moss and redwood decay, but it no doubt contains particulate dust rich in the nutrients of the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>Some people don’t believe in a higher power. But how can you deny the beauty and might of the life-water that powers the great blue marble we call Earth?</p>
