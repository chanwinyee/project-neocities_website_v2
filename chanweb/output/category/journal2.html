    <p>Going retro with some watercolour how-to's.</p>
    <p>Today, I finished a painting from the WTF Still Life how-to book and I am not in love with it. </p>
<p>I understand that these books were written in the late 50's and the photo references are of that time. I also understand that I could just disengage from that prompt. But I am a completist - and being a completist means muscling through exercises that I may not be thrilled about. </p>
<p>For this piece, I experimented with doing a bit of preparation before laying some paint down with the expectation that I would have a beautiful and finished work. I studied the turquoise marbles in gouache and oil. I practiced the shapes in pencil and set the canvas up with an under painting. I also went in with a mixing plan - starting with mid tones and giving myself warm and cold variations to mix with.</p>
<p>During that preparation time, I spent a lot of time with the source material. And during that time, I couldn't help but notice the absence of any attachment to the subject. </p>
<p>In one of my community art courses, the instructor advised the class to bring in a source photo of something that we cared about - a pet, a place, etc. At the time, she explained that we should work with something that we feel comfortable engaging with over a long period of time. Two years later, I now realize the value of an emotional attachment to the source material, great or small. </p>
<p>So, for this assignment, instead of working and re-working the piece until I felt that familiar gratification, I just stopped. And that's okay.</p>

<p>A Study in Two Mediums - my exploration of water colour</p>
<p>A few months ago, I received my Grandfather's collection of art books - the Walter T. Foster series from the late 60's. You may recognize them now going for about $7 per book on the shelves of your local Blick Art Supply Store. (My grandfather's books still have their price tag of $1.00 per. After a cursory search for supporting source materials by the same series, I observed the price of these books go from $1.00 to $1.50 and $2.00 and so on. Oh, the joys of inflation!)</p>
<p>I joke that I decided to learn more about water colour in 2021 so I can put some experience to my dislike of the medium. The truth is, I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and gain some level of competence over such a ubiquitous form of art. With plenty of vintage resources on hand, I felt well equipped to commence.</p>
<p>A few things I learned in my water colour practice:
- Water colour is the balance of strategically acting on paint as I watch it hit various stages of "drying"
- Layers, layers, layers
- Swatching reveals all
- Start broad and general, then indulge in the details (similar to oil)
- It is going to look pretty disappointing until it doesn't
- Patience. (I'm watching paint dry, aren't I?)
- Happy accidents happen, but water colour is an intentional technique. Try again.</p>
<p>Given all these realizations, this meant that most of my final water colour pieces were attempted at least twice. :)</p>
<p>What I am showing here is the last project to transition me back to my oil painting ways and commend my perseverance with the (sometimes) frustrating medium of water colour. </p>
<p>The water colour piece was attempted twice. The first time, I tried to keep the concept broad and general and let my confidence apply the first layer of yellow wash. As I continued to add my second colour (red), I realized I was cornered into a short range of hues - I had started off with too deep of a yellow. Turns out, broadness doesn't just mean shape; it also means hue. I also forgot the leave space for the whites and my apples were sinking into the image. Bah!</p>
<p>After some space from the subject, I tried again and found with patience, masking fluid, and a mindful approach to colour composition, I could actually produce something that felt realistic. In other words, I am quite proud of how I pushed my mind through this last work-through.</p>
<p>This water colour opened my eyes to the true indulgence of detail that water colour allows. I could really feel the subject's dimensions manifest with each layer of translucent paint deepening the colours. I could play in minute details with little risk as I gently concentrated pigment in semi-dry areas. Unlike my oils, the water colours created a crisper and thus more realistic end product.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now that it is 2022 and I finished not one but three books* on water colour practice, I've decided to go back to home base and pick up my oil paints again. It felt nice to work through the familiar development points of pencil, shaggy first colour layers, and eventually refinement. I can work and rework areas of the image until I feel it's ready and I can take my time on my own pace irrespective of the dryness and wetness. While I feel the water colour let me play a bit more with the tiniest of details, I enjoy the generalization I bring to my subjects in oil. </p>
<p>More interestingly, I think I am starting to recognize a style emerging at this point with my oils. While my water colours have an almost accidentally realistic feel accompanied by a slightly uncomfortable wobble (markings of a dedicated novice!), my oils have a more confident presence. They are stylized and simplified - details are there but mostly by suggestion and movement over flat-on appearance. While do indulge in the details, it feels a lot less meticulous than water colour and as a result, I can take in the whole painting and assess before I act.</p>
<p>I know in the long run, I will never escape the practice of water colour. Simply put, it is just easy to bring around on trips and I can finish a single piece in one sitting. I do also enjoy a meticulous bout with details once in a while - an indulgence that is both (maybe equally?) mind wracking and rewarding... when I have the patience to watch paint dry. </p>

<p>Dear Reader,</p>
<p>You must be here because you want to know more about me. Well, if you've made it this far, it's highly likely that you are a really kind person or you are someone I know personally. So, I will write these letters with these assumptions.</p>
<p>So, here we are on Neocities; a place where time has been frozen in the days of internet innocence - or so we like to remember.</p>
<p>I feel a whole lot of nostalgia for the internet of this time because I work for or with the less innocent internet companies of today. As you all probably know, I work in HR (or People) and often feel pretty separate from the debates and decisions over the more contentious aspects of <i>those</i> companies. I would say, though, that deep down inside, I long for a simpler life... but that's no surprise, is it, Reader? :)</p>
<p>Who would have thought that there may actually be a middle-road between the openness of social feeds and the privacy of an analog world?</p>
<p>Well, that's what I believe in - the middle road.</p>
<p>... Wow - what a heavy pre-amble. As usual, I just dive right into the serious thoughts, eh?</p>
<p>On to more lighter topics - this website in and of itself! Aside from my original Geocities (where it was a picture of me at the Grand Canyon at the ripe old age of 10 years and some funny gifs I found on the web), this is my first <i>real</i> website. Sure, I had a few pre-fabricated blog-type accounts, but this is the rawest form of website from my mind. </p>
<p>Like sharing my art, sharing this website feels like I am sharing something personal, sensitive, whatever word you want to replace "vulnerable" with. </p>
<p>Given that, this website is my first attempt at using CSS to stylize everything. I wrote this on a long airplane ride <i>sans internet</i>. I used some templates saved prior to the flight and the auto-fill helper in VisualStudio Code. While some people lean on StackExchange to unblock development, I muscled through without access to the World Wide Web. </p>
<p>Clearly, I'm really proud of how it came out!</p>
<p>Sure, there are a bunch of tools out there to build some more advanced websites (Gatsby.js, Flask, etc.) but I just needed a simple website. No ads, no continuous scroll, no analytics trackers, no "back-end." Just a website with some space to post up images of my work and long form text of my thoughts. :)</p>

    <p>The poetry of a steep incline.</p>
    <p>It was a 5 mile climb up 1,300 feet of elevation. I started out my door at 7:00am with a perfectly ripe banana in my belly and two hydration packs filled with optimism. </p>
<p>There were moments where the incline appeared low. But these deceptions are a guaranteed slow burn on my quads. The Berkeley terrain is a mix of self-sustaining urban farms pregnant with dropping stone fruits and the flittering of squirrels or maybe budgies tossing dry leaves in search of seed. I typically run in the middle of the road this early in the morning - opting for the view of the horizon and an unobstructed panoramic view of my path forward. With my ears free of any buds and my mind given reprieve from the drone of my rumination, I like to take these quiet hours of the morning to embrace the beauty of my city. </p>
<p>I ran upwards into the Berkeley Hills gritting my teeth through the challenge of the improbably steep blocks of Cedar, Shasta, and Grizzly Peak. Every stop for breath came with a barrage of encouraging self-pep talk: “You are strong!” “You’ve already recovered your breathing, great work!” “Long slow distance. Just enjoy this!” </p>
<p>As I neared the peak of my planned route, I noticed the air around me was thick with mist. Visibility was at 20-30 feet at best. This is the morning-dew taking rise to float across the world’s atmosphere. I could not help but deeply breathe in this aspirated volume of atmospheric river. I know some of this air came from Africa, the mountains of China, the snows of the Arctic. This damp smell is a mix of the moss and redwood decay, but it no doubt contains particulate dust rich in the nutrients of the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>Some people don’t believe in a higher power. But how can you deny the beauty and might of the life-water that powers the great blue marble we call Earth?</p>

    <p>My work-life balance is wayyyy out of balance.</p>
    <p>Dear Reader, </p>
<p>I am anthropomorphizing you today because 1) you are a person over there on the other side of the screen and 2) I have spent so many years writing to you without more obviously explaining our relationship.</p>
<p>I am one of those people who needs to process ideas out loud - whether that's verbal or written. Over the past year, I've spent a lot of that processing time writing in a private notebook - non judging, free-form, and raw. However, as of late, I incurred a wrist injury that makes physical journal writing painful. My thoughts have bottled themselves up, festered, and pulled my mind down into the depths of a sea of rumination.</p>
<p>Reader, you have been that silent listener who gives my thoughts that boundless space to spread out with little to no consequence. Whether my words have moved you or flitted quickly past your eye in an endless scroll, my trust in your presence has given my ideas a place to exist. For that, I am very thankful.</p>
<p>You see, I am one of those drones you see walking/driving around the city. I wake up every day, buzzing around to the no where that I am going. I toil day-in and day-out moving ideas from one virtual environment to another virtual environment to no end yet with little effect on the tangible world I live in. I look at my many screens tapping and swiping my waking hours away just so I can start that daily Countdown before the next round of Toil we call Work. </p>
<p>The ever disingenuous "hey, how's it goin'?" in answer to another empty "hey, how's it goin'?" reminds me of how pervasive the infection of corporate speak riddles the identities of the people I can only assume have better lives than me in the Countdown hours before the next Work Day.</p>
<p>Reader, you are the only place that sees me as more than a frustrated cycle of corporate tools and efficiency models. You are privy to the language that make me a tangible being in the world - the thoughts I indulge when I at last find the courage to break the cycle of Toil.</p>
<p>It's been a long time, Reader. My Courage has faltered many times since I've been shut in - forced to bring the Toil into the sacred physical space of my Countdown hours. I am stretched. I am dry. It is in these moments that my Courage physically knocks me down to stop the self-harming effects of the Toil on my tangible humanity.  </p>
<p>Today, I questioned what my humanity is. Why am I even alive if the Toil controls my waking hours? Am I even alive?</p>
<p>Reader, you are evidence of my aliveness. You know that these words were produced by a mind that is here.</p>
