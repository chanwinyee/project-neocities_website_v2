<p>A Study in Two Mediums - my exploration of water colour</p>
<p>A few months ago, I received my Grandfather's collection of art books - the Walter T. Foster series from the late 60's. You may recognize them now going for about $7 per book on the shelves of your local Blick Art Supply Store. (My grandfather's books still have their price tag of $1.00 per. After a cursory search for supporting source materials by the same series, I observed the price of these books go from $1.00 to $1.50 and $2.00 and so on. Oh, the joys of inflation!)</p>
<p>I joke that I decided to learn more about water colour in 2021 so I can put some experience to my dislike of the medium. The truth is, I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and gain some level of competence over such a ubiquitous form of art. With plenty of vintage resources on hand, I felt well equipped to commence.</p>
<p>A few things I learned in my water colour practice:
- Water colour is the balance of strategically acting on paint as I watch it hit various stages of "drying"
- Layers, layers, layers
- Swatching reveals all
- Start broad and general, then indulge in the details (similar to oil)
- It is going to look pretty disappointing until it doesn't
- Patience. (I'm watching paint dry, aren't I?)
- Happy accidents happen, but water colour is an intentional technique. Try again.</p>
<p>Given all these realizations, this meant that most of my final water colour pieces were attempted at least twice. :)</p>
<p>What I am showing here is the last project to transition me back to my oil painting ways and commend my perseverance with the (sometimes) frustrating medium of water colour. </p>
<p>The water colour piece was attempted twice. The first time, I tried to keep the concept broad and general and let my confidence apply the first layer of yellow wash. As I continued to add my second colour (red), I realized I was cornered into a short range of hues - I had started off with too deep of a yellow. Turns out, broadness doesn't just mean shape; it also means hue. I also forgot the leave space for the whites and my apples were sinking into the image. Bah!</p>
<p>After some space from the subject, I tried again and found with patience, masking fluid, and a mindful approach to colour composition, I could actually produce something that felt realistic. In other words, I am quite proud of how I pushed my mind through this last work-through.</p>
<p>This water colour opened my eyes to the true indulgence of detail that water colour allows. I could really feel the subject's dimensions manifest with each layer of translucent paint deepening the colours. I could play in minute details with little risk as I gently concentrated pigment in semi-dry areas. Unlike my oils, the water colours created a crisper and thus more realistic end product.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now that it is 2022 and I finished not one but three books* on water colour practice, I've decided to go back to home base and pick up my oil paints again. It felt nice to work through the familiar development points of pencil, shaggy first colour layers, and eventually refinement. I can work and rework areas of the image until I feel it's ready and I can take my time on my own pace irrespective of the dryness and wetness. While I feel the water colour let me play a bit more with the tiniest of details, I enjoy the generalization I bring to my subjects in oil. </p>
<p>More interestingly, I think I am starting to recognize a style emerging at this point with my oils. While my water colours have an almost accidentally realistic feel accompanied by a slightly uncomfortable wobble (markings of a dedicated novice!), my oils have a more confident presence. They are stylized and simplified - details are there but mostly by suggestion and movement over flat-on appearance. While do indulge in the details, it feels a lot less meticulous than water colour and as a result, I can take in the whole painting and assess before I act.</p>
<p>I know in the long run, I will never escape the practice of water colour. Simply put, it is just easy to bring around on trips and I can finish a single piece in one sitting. I do also enjoy a meticulous bout with details once in a while - an indulgence that is both (maybe equally?) mind wracking and rewarding... when I have the patience to watch paint dry. </p>

    <p>My first website since the 90's. Welcome!</p>
    <iframe src="/Journal/sounds/20211125-building_a_website_from_scratch.wav" width="100%" height="50" ></iframe>

<p>Dear Reader,</p>
<p>You must be here because you want to know more about me. Well, if you've made it this far, it's highly likely that you are a really kind person or you are someone I know personally. So, I will write these letters with these assumptions.</p>
<p>So, here we are on Neocities; a place where time has been frozen in the days of internet innocence - or so we like to remember.</p>
<p>I feel a whole lot of nostalgia for the internet of this time because I work for or with the less innocent internet companies of today. As you all probably know, I work in HR (or People) and often feel pretty separate from the debates and decisions over the more contentious aspects of <i>those</i> companies. I would say, though, that deep down inside, I long for a simpler life... but that's no surprise, is it, Reader? :)</p>
<p>Who would have thought that there may actually be a middle-road between the openness of social feeds and the privacy of an analog world?</p>
<p>Well, that's what I believe in - the middle road.</p>
<p>... Wow - what a heavy pre-amble. As usual, I just dive right into the serious thoughts, eh?</p>
<p>On to more lighter topics - this website in and of itself! Aside from my original Geocities (where it was a picture of me at the Grand Canyon at the ripe old age of 10 years and some funny gifs I found on the web), this is my first <i>real</i> website. Sure, I had a few pre-fabricated blog-type accounts, but this is the rawest form of website from my mind. </p>
<p>Like sharing my art, sharing this website feels like I am sharing something personal, sensitive, whatever word you want to replace "vulnerable" with. </p>
<p>Given that, this website is my first attempt at using CSS to stylize everything. I wrote this on a long airplane ride <i>sans internet</i>. I used some templates saved prior to the flight and the auto-fill helper in VisualStudio Code. While some people lean on StackExchange to unblock development, I muscled through without access to the World Wide Web. </p>
<p>Clearly, I'm really proud of how it came out!</p>
<p>Sure, there are a bunch of tools out there to build some more advanced websites (Gatsby.js, Flask, etc.) but I just needed a simple website. No ads, no continuous scroll, no analytics trackers, no "back-end." Just a website with some space to post up images of my work and long form text of my thoughts. :)</p>
