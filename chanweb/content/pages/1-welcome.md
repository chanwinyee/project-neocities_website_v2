Welcome to my personal and creative repository!

I am a **relentless hobbyist** most of the time and the rest of the time, I am a cat-mom, a loving partner, and a Data Engineer for HR/People data. Best of all, I am based out of beautiful Berkeley, CA. 

Here you will find a collection of my [writings](https://chanwinyee.neocities.org/category/journal.html), my [art](https://chanwinyee.neocities.org/category/artwork.html), and some of my [projects](https://chanwinyee.neocities.org/category/sketchbook.html).
