Welcome to my little creativity corner.

I'm Liz - a part-time artist, part-time corporate cog, and full-time hobbyist.

Here you will discover the breadth and wealth of my art, projects, and thoughts. I try to keep my day job in the backburner after hours. :)

As you may have noticed, I don't have a particularly robust online presence and this website is mostly a one-way conversation, but I hope you can still walk away with some inspiration. If you *really* want to get in touch, navigate on over to my Contact Me page and reach out!

Have a wonderful time!
