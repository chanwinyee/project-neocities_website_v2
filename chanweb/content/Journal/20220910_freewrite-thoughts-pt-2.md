Summary: The next step for my obsession with Astrohaus's Freewrite and not buying it.

After months of agonizing over my option to purchase the $700 Freewrite, I finally pulled the plug on that dream. Here I am, writing on the original version of this analogue crafting concept - the Alphasmart NEO. 

You can probably search the internet for this device and find a lot of articles written by professional bloggers praising the device for its simplicity. Interestingly, I can't help but sense that this the novelty of writing on the low-tech device forces the function of mindfulness. So, yes, you're goin to find a lot of articles that are mindfully written explaining the sensation of not have wi-fi or color to meet a writing deadline. I dig it.

A few weeks ago, I got a pre-release email for the [alpha by Freewrite](https://alphasmart.com/reveal/). Like many others of this extremely niche market, I was astounded by the similarity to the Aphasmart NEO (and similar products.) 

The main difference between the devices is that the NEO (on eBay) was $50, two times the cost it was 30 years ago; and the ALPHA is going to go for $349. Sure, the ALPHA has a modern design-ish, but the bottom line is - for someone with as fragmented a history of blogging as I, the cheaper option may be a better test of intention and worthiness.

I tweeted about my writing upgrade [here](https://twitter.com/ChanwinyeeMakes/status/1568763994416246784). Check it out in action!
