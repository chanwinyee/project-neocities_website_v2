Summary: The poetry of a steep incline.

It was a 5 mile climb up 1,300 feet of elevation. I started out my door at 7:00am with a perfectly ripe banana in my belly and two hydration packs filled with optimism. 

There were moments where the incline appeared low. But these deceptions are a guaranteed slow burn on my quads. The Berkeley terrain is a mix of self-sustaining urban farms pregnant with dropping stone fruits and the flittering of squirrels or maybe budgies tossing dry leaves in search of seed. I typically run in the middle of the road this early in the morning - opting for the view of the horizon and an unobstructed panoramic view of my path forward. With my ears free of any buds and my mind given reprieve from the drone of my rumination, I like to take these quiet hours of the morning to embrace the beauty of my city. 

I ran upwards into the Berkeley Hills gritting my teeth through the challenge of the improbably steep blocks of Cedar, Shasta, and Grizzly Peak. Every stop for breath came with a barrage of encouraging self-pep talk: “You are strong!” “You’ve already recovered your breathing, great work!” “Long slow distance. Just enjoy this!” 

As I neared the peak of my planned route, I noticed the air around me was thick with mist. Visibility was at 20-30 feet at best. This is the morning-dew taking rise to float across the world’s atmosphere. I could not help but deeply breathe in this aspirated volume of atmospheric river. I know some of this air came from Africa, the mountains of China, the snows of the Arctic. This damp smell is a mix of the moss and redwood decay, but it no doubt contains particulate dust rich in the nutrients of the Amazon rainforest.

Some people don’t believe in a higher power. But how can you deny the beauty and might of the life-water that powers the great blue marble we call Earth?
