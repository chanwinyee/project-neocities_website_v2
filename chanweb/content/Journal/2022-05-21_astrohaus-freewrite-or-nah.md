Summary: The agonizing debate that has occupied my brain power for 2 years and counting! To buy, or not to buy this nod to retro tech?

I would not qualify myself as much of a writer. But I would qualify myself as a bit of a tech junky. It’s not really about the need to have the latest and greatest in trendy tech (think iPhone). I’m a technologist who is constantly seeking ways to relive the glory days of a less technical past; maybe something like « retro tech . » I would qualify retro tech as any device that throws our state of mind back to the more innocent times of technology.

The internet. The Internet! I was alive during the beginning times of the Internet. When I was in elementary school, I had friends whose families just bought their first household computers. At that time, computers were a thing that households had *one* of and people were expected to *share* especially considering the Internet took up *the* phone line. 

So, knowing that these were my beginnings, you can assume I saw the slow evolution from that time to this time where a blue screen is constantly in alight in our faces and buzzing in our pockets. What started as an optimistic foray into an innocent relationship between human and electric patterns has turned into a playground that leaves us with bittersweet feelings of both joy and sometimes regret. Connections made and maintained with ease and satisfying depth accompanied by hours of absent minded if not anxiety inducing media consumption. 

Computers are still far from the days of Skynet (or Genesys) but they have found their way into my subconscious. I find that the notifications and checking behavior pervade my ability to focus on a simple task - like writing this article.

Enter the Astrohaus Freewrite. This tool is a word processor that attaches a mechanical keyboard to an e-ink display. The idea is that the colour less, back-light-less screen devoid of applications or notifications can help unblock writer’s block and get the user to just simply write. Like an elimination diet, this technology aims to purify the digestive tract of the mind and reset the writing creative with the right building blocks and some basic tools.

This promise sounds so very attractive. I have been obsessed with the idea of using this tool for the past 2 years! After hours and hours of positive video reviews and write-ups, I am absolutely convinced that this tool is the exact tool needed to power up my potential.

Or rather, I *was* convinced. How did the great writers of our past learn how to write so well? The answer is - they just wrote. There was no magic pen or paper. There was just the magic in their minds. And the will to build and maintain a solid foundation of recording the words in their mind.

After the excessive emotional shopping I committed during the COVID-19 pandemic, I felt a bit of emptiness. All this stuff and  no time or energy to use it all. Like the extra everything I hoarded during this fraught time, I knew had I bought the Freewrite, it, too, would sit collecting dust on a forgotten shelf. 

The thing with technology is that there is often a company behind it. This company takes a hold of a vulnerable mind injects its clever marketing to fill that void created by relaxed judgement. Whether it’s an ad that pops up during my daily doom-scroll or a targeted advertisement showing up on my internet search engine, these integrated suggestions lured my technology addicted mind down a 2 year negotiation of whether I would truly find fulfillment with this $600 tool.

So, instead of further pushing myself into the depths of consumerism, I’ve decided to withhold. Instead I will use other focus tools and techniques to give myself the space to think. Nothing is more powerful than the applied mind. If it can fully choose to shut off external manipulations, I am sure it can achieve that level of quiet, retro focus that my generation… that I seek.
