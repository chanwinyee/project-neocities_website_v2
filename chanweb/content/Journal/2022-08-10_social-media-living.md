Summary: Learning to live without the social media, then easing back in.

For the past 2-3 months, I have been without Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. This is not a personal vendetta against social media. It is simply a step away from the forces that seem to have a somewhat unreasonable hold over my free time.

I personally do not have a strong opinion about Social Media as some do. I just recognize that it has a lot of issues that give me pause.

1. It is addictive.
2. Social Media can make or break self-validation in the creative world.
3. Comparison is the enemy of joy and so is its conduit.
4. It can foster inauthentic or parasympathetic relationships and give the illusion of community where none exists.

I was not burned by SM, I simply wanted to do more with my free time and pump my calendar with intentional minutes. But now, after some space, I feel I have a use for SM as a *tool* rather than entertainment. This can either be a gateway to SM-Hell or the beginnings of a healthy relationship to SM.

What comes to mind is the question of whether it is even reasonable to strive to be an internet hermit.

I am an office-job worker. This means that my entire job is on the Internet. So internet hermitage is impossible 20-25 hours per week. Discounting sleeping hours (56 hours per week), that means ~85 hours a week can potentially be "free" of the internet. But, then, how do I optimize these precious 85 hours peppered throughout the week? *I use the internet to search things!* 

So the question becomes - who is the enemy? Is it the internet and all its temptations? Does it even matter?

What I am trying to get at is the fact that the environment has changed. I cannot continue the pattern of blaming every innovation for succumbing to the greedy manipulations of corporations. That is literally always going to happen. It is up to the power of my mind to know when to step back and when to wade in the waters of the ocean. 

All of this was to set the stage. I am mindfully engaging with SM by splitting my intentions into different accounts.

## My personal accounts
- I have a personal Twitter. This only has bi-directional relationships with people that I still talk to or would stop in the street to chat with for a few minutes if the chance ever came up.
- I have a public Twitter. This is [@chanwinyeemakes](https://twitter.com/chanwinyeemakes). The goal of this account is to share the process of my work - thoughts and photos together. While I do enjoy watching a good Instagram story, the pressure to perform on that platform is too high. There's a lot more mental work that a photo or a marginally acceptable IG Story can capture. Short form blog is the best route for me.
- Speaking of Instagram, I have a private account that I really don't use. The platform has become too advertisement-heavy (via influencers and rising influencers-to-be) that I am coming to terms with the notion that IG is not a place where I have authentic interactions with my peers, family, and friends.
- I have a public Instagram - [@winyee.art](http://instagram.com/winyee.art/). This will eventually become my portfolio. Simple as that.

By dividing my interfaces in such a way, I can make sure I am in a healthy state of mind. I can also practice varying types of openness depending on the platform and break through my internet shy-ness. Eventually, my interaction with SM will hopefully start becoming a two-way conversation.

Social Media, like the internet itself, is just a tool and it's here to stay. While outright rejection may be the first defensive response to its alluring power, coexistence or even mastery may be the best long-term approach.
