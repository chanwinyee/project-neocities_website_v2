Summary: A strange encounter at the hotel cafeteria.

I’m here at the cafeteria of the Hampton Inn. My phone went off at 6:30am, but I was already awake. The sun peeped through the windows with the vigour of a midday show.

The plan today is to go to Hearst Castle. A 40 minute drive to the visitor center before the 30 minute winding road up to the property. I’m looking forward to the tour even if we’ve done it once before. My biggest concern is the heat and UV. Yesterday, at lunch, we ate outside and I was sunburned through my top. 

Here at the cafe, there is a family celebrating graduation (or similar.) They are a Texan family who boasted loudly of their gun collection and mentioned the mass shootings in the Bay Area - San Jose. The tone was relaxed; a sharp contrast to the low and muted murmur of a community shocked and saddened. “I have an AR-15,” drawled the new grad with a casual, if not praise-seeking voice. Her boy friend smartly replied with a glowing review of their recent shooting range date before sliding past the crowd to grab breakfast. The extended family glowed proudly, confident that the next generation will carry on the family tradition.

As the boyfriend passed, we locked eyes. 

For a man coming from a culture that identifies himself as the norm and me, a Chinese woman, as “other”, I could not help but wonder what kind of mental math ran through his mind in that moment.

What a strange interaction. These interactions give me pause and a heightened sense of awareness.
